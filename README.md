## This Branch
This branch is working on <b>r</b>efactoring the <b>p</b>ackaged <b>d</b>ata classes, hence the branch name.

The end goal is to remove packaged data classes from the files that they are the data for into a master file of packaged data.  This should make 
it easier to check back on certain packaged data classes without rooting through all the files for the class it is the data class for.
